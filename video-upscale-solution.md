# Neural_G_5 Video Upscaling Solution

## Current Status
- File: Neural_G_5.mp4
- Size: ~12MB
- Goal: Upscale resolution without increasing file size

## Recommended Solutions

### Option 1: AI-Based Upscaling with Better Compression
Use tools like:
- **Real-ESRGAN** for AI upscaling
- **FFmpeg with HEVC/H.265** for better compression
- **Topaz Video Enhance AI** (commercial solution)

### Option 2: Cloud-Based Solutions
- **Runway ML** - AI video enhancement
- **Adobe After Effects** with AI upscaling
- **DaVinci Resolve** with AI enhancement

### Option 3: Browser-Based Solutions
- **Clipchamp** (Microsoft)
- **Kapwing** AI video enhancer
- **FlexClip** video upscaler

## Implementation Strategy

Since direct video processing is restricted in this environment, here are the steps:

1. **Download the current video** from the assets folder
2. **Use external AI upscaling tool** (recommended: Real-ESRGAN or Topaz)
3. **Apply optimized compression** during export:
   - Use H.265/HEVC codec
   - Maintain or reduce bitrate
   - Keep original frame rate
   - Use variable bitrate (VBR) for efficiency

4. **Replace the original file** with the upscaled version

## Technical Settings for Size Optimization

```bash
# Example FFmpeg command (for reference):
ffmpeg -i Neural_G_5.mp4 -vf "scale=1920:1080" -c:v libx265 -crf 28 -preset medium -c:a aac -b:a 128k Neural_G_5_upscaled.mp4
```

Where:
- `scale=1920:1080` - upscale to desired resolution
- `libx265` - efficient H.265 codec
- `crf 28` - constant rate factor (quality vs size balance)
- `preset medium` - encoding speed vs compression efficiency

## Expected Results
- Resolution: 2x upscale (e.g., 720p â†’ 1440p)
- File size: Same or 10-20% smaller due to better compression
- Quality: Enhanced detail through AI processing

## Next Steps
Would you like me to:
1. Create a script to automate this process?
2. Provide specific tool recommendations?
3. Set up the replacement workflow?
