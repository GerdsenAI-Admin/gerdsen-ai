# Gerdsen.ai Website Analysis & Testing Recommendations

## Website Evaluation

### Overall Impression
The gerdsen.ai website has successfully launched with a sleek, professional design featuring a dark theme that's appropriate for an AI technology company. The Apple-inspired design elements we implemented are visible, creating a premium feel.

### Observations from Testing

#### Positive Aspects
- Clean, modern dark theme aesthetic
- Responsive layout (even viewed in the testing browser)
- Professional typography with proper hierarchy
- Gradient text effects for emphasis on key headings
- Clear call-to-action buttons
- Logical section organization

#### Issues/Improvement Areas
- Missing resource (404 error in console)
- Placeholder content still present ("AI Model Visualization" placeholder image)
- **Hero Animation Not Working Correctly**: The hero banner animation sequence is not functioning as intended. It should follow this sequence:
  1. Animated hero banner initially visible
  2. As the user scrolls, the hero banner should remain stationary while text appears
  3. The hero banner should then zoom out or exit the frame
  4. Smoke or particle effects should appear when text comes into view
- The sticky sections and other Apple-style effects are not functioning as expected
- Limited visibility of some text against the dark background

### Scrolling & Layers
The scrolling functionality works, but there are significant animation and layer issues:
- **Hero Animation Sequence Broken**: The hero banner doesn't follow the intended sequence (animated banner → stationary with text appearing → zoom out/exit → smoke/particle effects)
- The video background elements aren't visible in the live site
- Sections that should have parallax effects appear static
- The Apple-style sticky showcase sections are not functioning correctly
- Layer depth and 3D effects are not properly implemented
- Transitions between sections lack the smooth, animated quality seen in the reference sites
